After that, we zero gradients of our network and pass observations to the network, obtaining its action scores. These scores are passed to the objective function, which calculates cross-entropy between the network output and the actions that the agent took.

    "The last check in the loop is the comparison of the mean rewards of our batch episodes. When this becomes greater than `199`, we stop our training. Why `199`? In Gymnasium, the CartPole environment is considered to be solved when the mean reward for last 100 episodes is greater than 195, but our method converges so quickly that 100 episodes are usually what we need. The properly trained agent can balance the stick infinitely long (obtaining any amount of score), but the length of the episode in CartPole is limited to 200 steps (if you look at the environment variable of CartPole, you may notice the `TimeLimit` wrapper, which stops the episode after 200 steps). With all this in mind, we will stop training after the mean reward in the batch is greater than `199`, which is a good indication that our agent knows how to balance the stick as a pro."
