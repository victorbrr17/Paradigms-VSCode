    "Main characteristics:\n",
    "- The game starts with the player at location [0,0] of the frozen lake grid world with the goal located at far extent of the world e.g. [3,3] for the 4x4 environment.\n",
    "- Holes in the ice are distributed in set locations when using a pre-determined map or in random locations when a random map is generated.\n",
    "- The player makes moves until they reach the goal or fall in a hole.\n",
    "- The lake is slippery (unless disabled) so the player may move perpendicular to the intended direction sometimes (see _is_slippery_ param).\n",
