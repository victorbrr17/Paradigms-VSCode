    "Blackjack environment is part of the Gymnasium's [Toy Text](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/) environments. Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by obtaining cards that sum to closer to 21 (without going over 21) than the dealer's cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The card values are, as depicted in the following figure:\n",
    "- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have a point value of **10**.\n",
    "- Aces can either count as **11** (called a \"usable ace\") or **1**.\n",
    "- Numerical cards (**2-9**) have a value equal to their number.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/BlackJackCards.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Game Dynamics:\n",
    "1. The game starts with the dealer having one face up and one face down card, while the player has two face up cards. All cards are drawn from an infinite deck (i.e. with replacement).\n",
    "2. The player has a total sum of cards. They can request additional cards (**hit**) until they decide to stop (**stick**) or exceed 21 (**bust**), which results in an immediate loss.\n",
    "3. After the player decides to stick, the dealer reveals their face-down card and draws cards until their total is 17 or greater. If the dealer goes bust, the player wins.\n",
    "4. If neither the player nor the dealer goes bust, the winner is whoever has a sum closer to 21.\n",
